!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
To change your Linrad program to fit your own hardware 
in a version independent way, make your own users_xxxx 
files as described below.
Do not forget to run configure after you have added a
users_xxxx file. (There is no need when you change the
file, the configure script updates your Makefile.)
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!                

The users_hwaredriver file only affects the Linux versions of
Linrad. To get your own routines into your Windows
executable, add a file wusers_hwaredriver.c. This file
will be used only when compiling linrad.exe.
(Do not forget to run ./configure once if you add 
users.... or wusers.... )
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



The user may add routines in (w)users_hwaredriver.c

These routines allow control of transmitter and receiver hardware
completely as the user wants.

For prototype functions look at users.c, users_tr.c and users_w3sz.c

Note that the file you create as (w)users_hwaredriver.c will not be
changed when you install new versions of Linrad on top of your
old installation. The distribution package does not contain
any file with this name. (Be careful to make a bakup anyway.
There is a small risk that a (w)users_hwaredriver.c has sneaked
into a package by mistake - and then it would over-write your file.

                  ******************************

The user may also make his own defines in (w)users_hwaredef.h
These defines will automatically replace the defines in hwaredef.h

For prototype definitions look at users.h

You may select your own pin assignments and still use the default
control routines in hwaredriver.c

Note that the file you create as users_hwaredef.h will not be
changed when you install new versions of Linrad on top of your
old installation. The distribution package does not contain
any file with this name.

                  *******************************

NOTE: You have to run configure after you added a users file to
have your own routines/defines compiled into Linrad.
