         The time delay from antenna to loudspeaker in Linrad.

Press 'T' on the processing screen to get timing information.
Linrad will show some text messages in the lower left corner of the
screen. Typically like this:

A/D:47998Hz  D/A:48008Hz sync:0.011422
DMA:  A/D:94 Hz   D/A:94 Hz
      Delay times
D/A   0.011   MIN  0.009
baseb 0.000   buf  0.036
timf3 0.025   fft3 0.000
timf2 0.027   fft2 0.000
  Raw 0.033   fft1 0.018
10.60% ( 3%)   Tot 0.150

In case the second fft is not present the line with timf2 and fft2
will not be present.


************* A/D:47998Hz  D/A:48008Hz sync:0.011422 ****************
The first line shows the actual sampling rates as evaluated by Linrad
by counting how many samples that actually arrived from or were sent
out to the device driver for the hardware. Abnormal values here should
not be accepted. Even small deviations like loosing 0.5% of the input
data blocks could cause transcients if strong signals are present.
Small errors could also cause digital decoders such as MAP65 to fail.

Silent loss of data at the input side are due to problems with device
drivers If you see such problems, try to change soundcard parameters,
make sure that no other applications open the sound drivers before
Linrad and reboot.
 
Loss of data on the output side is typically due to slow drivers. It can
also be caused by various errors in the Linrad setup. It may be a good
idea to select a sampling speed that is supported in hardware to avoid
inefficient resampling routines.


**************** DMA:  A/D:94 Hz   D/A:94 Hz *******************
The second line shows the size of the buffers that are requested for
the input and output expressed as the rate at which the buffers are
filled. In some systems this might actually be the DMA rate that the
hardware will use for moving data into the main memory.


********************      Delay times  *************************
****************   D/A   0.011   MIN  0.009 ********************

The third line is different depending on whether or not Portaudio
is selected for the output.

Without Portaudio:
D/A is the time associated with the data already sent to the 
output device driver. 

MIN is the  smallest value of D/A that ever occured.


With Portaudio:
D/A is the time associated with a single buffer.

MIN is the smallest time of available data waiting for output in the
daout buffer. (see fourth line)

*********************** baseb 0.000   buf  0.036  *********************

baseb is the amount of data in the baseband time function.

buf is the amount of data in the daout buffer.

The step from baseb to daout is a fractional resampler.


******************* timf3 0.025   fft3 0.000 ************************

The amount of data in the time function timf3.

The amount of data waiting as fourier transforms for back transformation
into baseb.

(Or corresponding times in case filter and decimation in the time domain
is selected.)


****************** timf2 0.027   fft2 0.000 ***********************
Only in case the second FFT is selected.


timf2 is the amount of data in the timf2 buffer

fft2 is the amount of data waiting as computed transforms.


******************  Raw 0.033   fft1 0.018  ***********************

Raw is the amount of data waiting in timf1 

fft1 is the amount of data waiting in the form of completed fft1 transforms.



******************  10.60% ( 3%)   Tot 0.150  *********************

The last line shows the total cpu load. 10.60% in this case.
The number within parenthesis is present on systems with more than one
cpu core. It shows the percentage of time that the most cpu-intensive thread
is using. This number must notgo very high. Up to 80% is probably OK.

Tot is the total delay. It is the sum of all the delays (MIN of course not
included)

*******************************************************************


There is an option in options.h #define BUFBARS TRUE that will show
the buffer usage graphically when 'T' is pressed. This option is
however rather cpu-intensive.
