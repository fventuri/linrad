The WSE units, RX10700, RX70, RX144 and RXHFA use
the parallel port to set the frequency (and for
the RXHFA also the gain)

When the parallel port is allowed the word
"parport" is visible on the main menu followed
by the parallel port address and the pin number
used to read status from the WSE units.

******************  Linux ***********************
Permission to use parallel ports below 0x400 
are obtained by a call to ioperm which does not
need very high privileges.
Higher addresses require iopl(3) and to have
permission one probably has to run as root.

******************  Windows  ********************
A user program can not access the parallel port 
directly under Windows. Linrad looks for inpout32.dll 
which should contain the functions iop32 and oup32 
which allow read and write on the parallel port.

Place inpout32.dll in the Windows system directory 
It comes from here:  http://www.logix4u.net
no explicit license is neede to use this dll for 
non - commercial applications.
