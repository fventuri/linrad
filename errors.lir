[1058]Output can not start.

(1)The parameter "Output delay margin (ms)" may be too small.
Try to set it large, like 1000 for a whole second.
If this helps, use 'T' to find out by how much you can reduce it.
The D/A MIN value should be about 20 milliseconds, if you see something
much larger, reduce the Output delay margin by the value minus 20 ms.
It may be necessary to repeat a couple of times until you find
MIN near 20.
Note that the MIN value should be evaluated after a couple of
minutes.

(2)Your CPU could be overloaded. Maybe you are trying to use
filter and decimation in the time domain with a large fft3?
Select filter/decimation in the frequency domain. '1' in the
box in the upper right corner of the baseband spectrum.

(3)You might have too demanding parameters for the wideband
processing. Use 'T' to find out how the different threads load 
your CPU(s)

(4)The parameter "Max DMA rate" could be set too low.

If the above does not help, please send a mail to leif@sm5bsz.com

[1200]OSS or alsa-oss is selected for the soundcards.
The Linrad configure script failed to locate the sound devices

Your system is probably not configured for the OSS API.
There are two alternatives:

1) Configure OSS and run ./configure followed by make. 
   The device files /dev/dsp or /dev/sound/dsp have to be present.

   If you use alsa-oss, the modules snd-mixer-oss and snd-pcm-oss
   have to be inserted to create the device files.
   Commands in the below order:
   modprobe snd-mixer-oss
   modprobe snd-pcm-oss 
   (./configure and make need to be run afterwards)

   If you use 4Front OSS, the device files should be present
   automatically.

2) Change to native ALSA. ('Y' on the RX setup menu.)
   The 'Y' option will not be present in case configure showed a 
   line "MISSING: libasound.so (or headers)"
   You must then install the ALSA development package.
   Run ./configure --with-help for info

This error may occur if native ALSA is not available. Then the second
alternative would not be available. In that case, run configure --with-help
to find out what is needed to get ALSA running or install 4Front OSS.

[1394]Could not open the Afedri USB control interface.
No device found.
This may happen if you have not waited long enough after
connecting your Afedri unit.
Try to start Linrad again.
[1395]Could not initialize the ELAD FDM-S1.
Unknown reason. Try co disconnect USB cable and connect again.
[1396]The file par_perseus is corrupted. 
Use "U=A/D and D/A setup for RX" in the main menu to create a new file.
[1397]Sampling rate in par_userint not compatible with FDM-S1 setup.
Rerun "U=A/D and D/A setup for RX" from the main menu.
[1398]Failed to open the Mirics USB unit.
This error is probably caused by incorrect drive routines.
Install the WinUSB driver from libusbx.org
Easiest is to use Zadig.
[1399]Failed to open the Mirics USB unit.
This might be due to permission problems with libusb.
Try to run as root.
Another module might be loaded for the unit.
Maybe one of these commands will help:
rmmod sdr-msi3101
rmmod msi2500
[1400]The file par_airspy is corrupted or not consistent
with other parameters. Use the U menu to set up your USB hardware
and do not forget to press W to save data in the main menu
afterwards.

[1407]Failed to open soundcard for Tx output.
[1408]The transmit output soundcard device number is out of range.
Use 'B' in the 'V=TX mode setup' to select proper device numbers for
the transmit soundcards.
[1409]The transmit input soundcard device number is out of range.

[1411]Failed to open output soundcard for the transmitter.
Use 'B' in the 'V=TX mode setup' to select proper device numbers for
the transmit soundcards.
[1412]The Perseus library is too old. Remove libperseus-sdr from your system.
To do that, use the command: locate libperseus-sdr.so
then delete the files listed. Typically these files:
/usr/local/lib/libperseus-sdr.so
/usr/local/lib/libperseus-sdr.so.0
/usr/local/lib/libperseus-sdr.so.0.0.0
It is recommended that you remove the libperseus-sdr directory also.
Typically like this:
rm -r /usr/src/libperseus-sdr
Then run this command in the Linrad directory:
./configure --with-help
copy the installation instructions for libperseus-sdr and paste 
them into the command window.
Note that you need root privileges.
[1413]The mirisdr library did not report how many gain levels it 
supports. Install a more modern library.
For Windows, use the latest setup-linrad-dll-package.exe and for Linux,
remove your libmirisdr.so files and run ./configure --with-help
to get instructions on how to install a modern library.
[1414]Something is wrong with your DLL files. 
Linrad will look for DLL files and associated binaries in the
special directory:
C:\Linrad\dll\
Download the file linrad-dll-filesxx.zip and unpack it into the
specified directory.
[1415]Call to Pa_Initialize returned an error.
If this happens on a Windows 10 system on which you have a Delta 44 you have 
to reconfigure the Delta 44. (Reboot or power off does not help.)
Use the M-Audio Delta Control Panel to set the sampling rate to 44100 Hz.
Then use U = A/D and D/A setup in the main menu to select Portaudio
for the soundcard with the ASIO or the WDM-KS driver.

You can select sampling rate, number of channels and number of bits freely.
according to your preferences. The Delta 44 is not locked to 44100, it just
has to inform Windows 10 that it is the default rate.
[1415]Call to Pa_Initialize returned an error.

[1421]Could not get device capabilities for tx input soundcard.
[1422]Inconsistent soundcard parameters for Windows Tx input.
Number of bits=24, but flag says do not use extended format.
Use 'U' on the main menu to set proper parameters for
your soundcard.
[1423]Could not get device capabilities for rx output soundcard.
[1424]waveOutOpen() failed for Tx soundcard output.
[1425]Could not get device capabilities for rx output soundcard.
[1426]waveInStart returned an error.
[1427]waveInStart returned an error for the second device.
[1428]The transmit setup is incorrect or transmit parameter files missing.
Use the 'V' menu to set up CW and/or SSB.
Do not forget to save at least one file, par_cwproc00 and/or par_ssbproc00.
[1429]A library can not be loaded. 
If you encounter this problem and do not see an obvious reason, please
provide feedback.
[1450]The Rx input thread did not start.
This lasted too long:
thread_status_flag for rx_input_thread not equal THRFLAG_ACTIVE
Probably the requested device is not connected to the computer.

[1468]Failed to open the SDRPlay USB unit.
This error is probably caused by incorrect drive routines.
Check that nobody else is using the device and the driver
is installed correctly.
[1469]Failed to open the SDRPlay USB unit.
This might be due to permission problems with libusb.
Try to add the user to right group or run as root (BAD).
Another module might be loaded for the unit.

rmmod msi2500
[1470]Error saving the par_sdrplay2 file. Check the permission.
