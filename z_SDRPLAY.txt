Some useful information about SDRplay RSPs


Hght Dynamic Range (HDR) mode

The SDRplay RSPdx and RSPdx-R2 have a High Dynamic Range (HDR) mode when operating below 2 MHz. More details are in this document: https://www.sdrplay.com/docs/RSPdxHDRMode.pdf

There are strict requirements in terms of sample rate, IF selection, and passband center frequency to be able to operate the RSPdx/RSPDX-R2 in HDR mode:
- the sampole rate must be 6Msps
- the IF frequency must be 1620kHz
- the passband center frequency must be one of the values in this list:
    135kHz
    175kHz
    220kHz
    250kHz
    340kHz
    475kHz
    516kHz
    875kHz
   1125kHz
   1900kHz

For passband center frequencies below 500kHz an internal hardware 500kHz LPF will be applied.
For passband center frequencies between 500kHz and 2MHz an internal hardware 2MHz LPF will be applied.
